# Deliverables for Machine Learning Course

This repository contains the following deliverables for the Machine Learning course, part of the Master's degree in Data Science and Machine Learning:

1. **Assignment 1: Decision Trees**
   - **Objective:** To build a success/failure classifier for students using the ID3 decision tree algorithm with variants.

2. **Assignment 2: Bayesian Learning**
   - **Objective:** To build a word predictor using the Naive Bayes algorithm.

3. **Assignment 3: Reinforcement Learning**
   - **Objective:** To build a reinforcement learning agent using the Q-Learning algorithm to efficiently solve the Taxi-v3 environment from the Gymnasium library.

4. **Assignment 4: Neural Networks**
   - **Objective:** To build a classifier for the Fashion-MNIST dataset using feedforward neural networks with PyTorch.
